/**
 * Fires when one of the following occurs:
 * * A cartʼs line items are modified by adding a new item to a cart, updating an existing itemʼs quantity, or deleting an item.
 * * A shopper enters or changes their email address during guest checkout. This includes signing in to a customer account after creating a guest cart, which associates the accountʼs email address with the cart.
 *
 * The `store/cart/created` webhook firing also triggers this webhook because adding a product to an empty cart is considered an update.
 *
 * Changes to the following fields trigger this event:
 * * Quantity
 * * Item Price
